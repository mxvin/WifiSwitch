# WifiSwitch -- Simple Multiple Wifi Connector for OpenWrt

Based on YAWAC Yet Another Wifi Auto Connect (YAWAC) https://github.com/mehdichaouch/YAWAC
is a shell script to connect to a dataset of wireless connection and free hotspot like FreeWifi. 
It's works on OpenWrt.

This script is based on my use scenario and it works! Hope you find it useful too..
Simple scenario using this script : Having 2nd Wireless USB (radio1) and wanna connect seamlessly
within different SSID, whether defined Access Point SSID is discovered.
Then, run this script using Cron every minute. * * * * *
